# Bike-Congestion
Bike congestion GPS model and prediction on Stanford's campus

All data from GPS biking logs around Stanford's campus are contained in GoodCSVs. To the travel time for specific paths, place the log in the predict folder.

ModelRegression.ipynb contains the code for running a multivariate polynomial regression model on the dataset and generating heat maps.
ModelNN.ipynb contains the code for running an artificial neural network model on the dataset and predicitng travel time.
